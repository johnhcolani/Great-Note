1. Information We Collect
   1.1. Personal Information
   Great Note does not collect any personal data such as your name, address, or contact information unless explicitly provided by you for specific features (e.g., backup options).

1.2. Device Information
We may collect non-personal information about your device, such as the device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers. This data is collected solely for the purpose of improving our service and ensuring app stability.

1.3. Data Stored in the App
All notes, images, and attachments you create within Great Note are stored locally on your device. If you choose to enable backup services (such as Google Drive or Dropbox integration), your data may be uploaded to the cloud storage of your choice, with your explicit permission. We do not have access to this data.

Any device-specific data collected (e.g., crash logs or performance data) is used strictly for diagnostic purposes to help improve the performance and functionality of the app.

3. Third-Party Services
   Great Note may use third-party services, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, if you enable backup or synchronization features. These services are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review these policies to understand how your data is treated by these third parties.
